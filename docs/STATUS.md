# Seat of Power — status (4 Oct)

## Removed: inauguration / First 100 Days and budget padding (Steve's decision)
- `public/sop-first100.js` deleted (every DAY scene, including "The oath, and then the microphone", the three speech drafts and the "Name the missing ₦40bn" line), plus its script tag.
- Budget padding step deleted: all "Padding your PA flagged" envelope cards (every sector) and their four choices, plus the Speaker's late-night constituency-project demand that lived in the same step. The budget itself (Batch F) stays; after a turn, play now goes straight to the budget.
- Readers removed or rewritten: godfather road rule, ledger padding/tribunal lines, SA signals, Wikipedia "First 100 days" section (now "Cabinet"), DAY-location citations, EFCC cause, and adviser and news wording that mentioned padding.
- Old saves: `scrubRemovedContent()` (inside `migrateSave`) moves a save sitting in the old padding phase to the budget and drops the DAY/padding ledger entries (and anything caused by them), logs, wiki events, the signature-road project and its procurement entries.

## Checks
- Codebase search ("padding", "inauguration", "oath", "First 100 Days", "₦40bn", scene titles): the only remaining hits are the scrubber's own patterns and comments, which never show to the player. Neutral "sworn in" mentions (wiki, tribunal) stay.
- Old-build save in the padding phase, with 3 DAY entries, loads on the new build cleanly on the Desk, with none of those entries left.
- Two in-game years (4 turns) each as Edo and as Lagos: 0 console errors, 0 traces of either group in screens, logs or the ledger, and turn 1 lands on the Desk.

## News anchors
- Permanent faces: Ibrahim Danjuma (navy suit, glasses) and Funmi Okeowo (burgundy suit).

## Art pack (Seat_of_Power_Art_Compressed.zip)
- All 92 images are converted to WebP in `public/art/` (4 MB in total). The anchors keep the faces Steve chose; the pack's copies are the same two people.
- Where the art now appears:
  - **Tab bar:** Desk, Map, People and Wiki use the drawn icons instead of emoji.
  - **Desk dilemmas:** every dilemma has a scene, for example a market fire with a trader, cholera with a doctor, a kidnap with a soldier at a classroom, floods, herder clashes at the emir's palace, a traditional-council bill with an emir or oba/obi depending on region, other bills with the Speaker, and the ASUU strike with a teacher.
  - **Economic shocks:** a pandemic shows a hospital ward, protests a street, a flood the flooded community, an attack the market, and an oil, naira or bank crash Abuja.
  - **Investors:** the construction site, with a Nigerian investor or a foreign engineer.
  - **Trips:** Abuja trips use the federal office; the Netherlands and other invitations use the airport.
  - **Intelligence reports:** the back room.
  - **Courts and bills:** every courtroom has the judge, and Assembly bills show the Speaker.
  - **Re-election:** the convention hall and party chairman (pleased or angry with party stability).
  - **Election day:** the polling unit.
  - **Flagship:** each programme has a scene.
- Deputies follow region: northern kaftan or hijab, isiagu in the SE/SS, a suit in the SW.
- Cabinet cards show a commissioner portrait for each minister.
- Kano (landscape) and Edo and Lagos (phone) runs: 0 console errors, no missing images.
- Not used: the governor, deputy, godfather and adviser mood variants. They show different people from the neutral portraits, so the face would change mid-game. Also not used: `opposition-candidate-alt` and `doctor-male`.
- Still open: the national coat of arms and real-organisation text in some images (see `public/art/README.md`).
